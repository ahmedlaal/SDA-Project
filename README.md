Project Description: Developing the Udemy App with Modeling Diagrams

The semester project entails the comprehensive development of the Udemy App, an educational platform, by utilizing multiple modeling diagrams. The objective is to design, visualize, and conceptualize the functionality and structure of the app using a range of modeling standards to ensure a well-defined and cohesive system.

Key Diagrams Implemented:

Use Case Diagrams: These diagrams capture the interactions between users (students, instructors, administrators) and the system (Udemy App). They illustrate the various functionalities accessible to different user roles and the relationships between them.

Communication Diagrams: These diagrams showcase the interactions between different components/modules of the Udemy App, emphasizing how they communicate and collaborate to fulfill specific tasks or functionalities.

Class Diagrams: Represent the static structure of the system by displaying classes, their attributes, methods, and relationships between classes, providing a clear overview of the system's data model.

Timing Diagrams: These diagrams depict the behavior of objects across a time axis, showcasing the timing constraints and interactions between elements of the system, highlighting the time it takes for actions to occur.

Sequence Diagrams: Illustrate the dynamic interactions between objects in a particular scenario or use case, showcasing the sequence of messages exchanged between objects to accomplish a specific task.

Activity Diagrams: Visualize the flow of activities or processes within the system, portraying the sequence of actions and decisions undertaken to achieve specific functionalities.

Outcome:

The ultimate goal of this semester project is to deliver a comprehensive, well-documented, and functional Udemy App prototype. Through the use of various modeling diagrams, the project aims to provide a structured and systematic approach to software development, emphasizing the importance of visual representation in understanding and implementing complex systems.
